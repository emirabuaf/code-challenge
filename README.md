here i share the link for heroku https://code-challenge-future.herokuapp.com/ but only thing you will see, will be error handling.
OMDBAPI is not sending search results in every input change and when there is no data to fetch error is getting caught and throws error, maybe it's not only about the api but at least i couldn't find any solution to that issue. but in your local system it will be working fine without any error.
